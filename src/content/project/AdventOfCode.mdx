# Description
Advent of Code is an annual event that provides a series of programming challenges throughout the month of December. Each day, a new problem is released, and participants can solve these problems using any programming language of their choice. The challenges are designed to be fun and engaging, often involving puzzles and algorithmic tasks that require creative problem-solving skills.
## Why Python?
I chose to use Python for Advent of Code for several reasons:

- **Ease of Use**: Python's syntax is clean and easy to read, which allows me to focus on solving the problem rather than dealing with complex syntax.
- **Rich Standard Library**: Python comes with a comprehensive standard library that includes modules for handling common tasks such as file I/O, string manipulation, and data structures, which are often needed for the challenges.
- **Rapid Development**: Python's high-level nature allows for rapid development and prototyping, making it ideal for tackling daily challenges within a limited time frame.
- **Community Support**: Python has a large and active community, which means there are plenty of resources, tutorials, and libraries available to help solve the problems efficiently.
- **Versatility**: Python is a versatile language that can handle a wide range of tasks, from simple scripts to complex algorithms, making it well-suited for the diverse nature of Advent of Code challenges.
